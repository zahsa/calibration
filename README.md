# calibration

The purpose of calibration is the estimation of the intrinsic and  extrinsic parameters of a camera given one  or  more  calibration  pattern. For collecting  the  image  coordinates  of  the calibration  pattern  the process of edge detection have to be done. Edge detection is important for specifying the coordinates of the vertices of the squares in the pattern calibration.
